# PicoCTG - picoGym Practice Challenges

Run `solve.sh` under any challenge directory to solve the challenge and output
the flag as well as create a `flag.txt` file with the flag in it.

Or run `solveAll.sh` to solve all challenges and output all the flags and
create `allFlags.txt` with all the flags in it.

`solveAll.sh` will just `cat` `allFlags.txt` if it exists.<br>
Use `--force` to force it to recreate the file.

Use `--force-all` to force solving of all challenges again.<br>
Otherwise it will just `cat` the existing `flag.txt` files.
